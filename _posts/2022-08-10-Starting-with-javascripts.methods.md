# Introduction

I was doing the JavaScript methods once more.

# Body

Today i was practicing the JavaScript methods once more just to get use of Javascript because it seems like it is hard for me to understand some of the JavaScript code so hence i will be practicing the JavaScript method i know that one of the good days i will get used to as time goes on but for now am starting to know more about JS so this practices will help me hence i was doing thuis methods today which are The sort,reverse,join,math.floor and also the reduce methods so i will have to understand them as quickly as i can because time is not on our side right now so i will keep on pushing as harder as i can 

# Conclusion

My conlusion is that i will have to study most of the methods of JavaScript then i will continue with my freecodecamp test. Thank you for reading my blog post.
