# Introduction 
I wanted to finish my Todo project but i was an able to do so.

# Body 

I could not do the project because of the laptop that i was using it just went off just like that it does not wanna light so today i was trying to check what id the problem wiht it but i could not find it so it just went of with all my project that i have done since i started doing projects so it such a pitty that i will have to start my Todo Project from the start and because now i am using  Raspberry ip now because it was the last thing that i can use for now and i was inserting some of the things that i used to have on the that laptop i was using before.

# Conclusion 
My conclusion is that i will continue using the rasberry IP thing until feather notice.
