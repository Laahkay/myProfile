# Introductiona

I was busy with other javascript methods such unshift and sort and unshift and pop.

# Body 

I have learned that the unshift method i have to do with the adding a variable of something that you want to add and it is used to add in the beggining of you array of object or strings and the sort method it is used to to set up you strings names of things such as human names and car names and others so it put the name variable in ascending order and then i have used the shift method which add the name of something our want to put then it put it in the beggining of the array or objects and lastly i was doing the pop method which is used to remove the first element in our array of object or string.

# Conclusion 

I will have to re-do what i  was doing in order to store  everything in my head about what i have learned which is the javascript methods . Thank you for reading my blog post
