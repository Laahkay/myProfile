# INTRODUCTION

Am doing react where by react is a popular JavaScript library for building reusable, component-drive user interfaces for the web pages/applications

# BODY

I started doing react of the how to create a simple JSX elements so it is where raect we use start to use the ReactDOM.render methods in order to understand how react works in JS so this method that uses the DOM function we call this our JSX into the react which is the lightweight which represent the DOM, So we use snapshorts of the its own DOM to optimize updating only specific parts of the actual DOM, and on the task i was asked to craete the JSX function where by i have to assign the div element to the JSX contact, And i was done with the task so i went to another task which was how to create a complex JSX Elements and the is this thing where by we sould know is that JSX when it is nested it should return a single element, and another is that we should know what is rendering is..Render but surelly we can render multiple elements and also we should wrap all our tags using the Div and the task needed us to return the element we we have finished appling our elements and at the end we should return our JSX element in our React Components.

# CONCLUSION
