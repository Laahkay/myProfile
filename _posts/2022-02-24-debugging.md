# introduction

I was doing debugging is t can turn on or off, also it force errors to be reported to the user.

# 

the debuggers keywords stops the execution of JS  and calls if the available the debugging functions and you can also set the breakpoint in the JavaScript code, We use debugging in JS to identify these errors we need to Debugger  that can go through the entire code and we identify the errors and also fix them, the debugger keyword is used in the code force stop the executing of the code at a breaking point and calls the debuggung function, Here is an example of the debugger turnd on --> let x = 15 * 5;
debugger;
document.getElementbyId("demo").innerHTML = x; <--- yeah thats the example,

# conclusion

I have found it little bit though and its kind'a giving me some challengies this course of debugging but i will re do it once more until i understand it.
