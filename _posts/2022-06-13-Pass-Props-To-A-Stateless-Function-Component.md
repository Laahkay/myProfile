# Introduction 

I will be speaking about what i have done which is feecodecamp which is how to pass props to a stateless function component.

# Body 

Its where by i have to pass props to a child component and its where i would have to create a stateless function and the way i understand it its that  we have to set a stateless function which is calender and pass props arguement and again we have to include some os the date so i have to make a plan in order to bring the current date and time as well so it was so difficult to figure it out  and i was able to by reading aloud  and by understanding passing props inside the p element.

although i was a good test and i have made it clear to my self that i shall pass it and at the end of the day i have made it through because i did not want to ask for help i test my mind that how far can it bring out of me but i surely understand it and i was able to pass the test as i took time and the example from freecodecamp of passing stateless function component is here down below.

# Conclusion 

i have learned so much today and which made me to overthink but though i was totaly worth it so i will be going back on where i have began on React because i need more better understanding thats all i can say for today Thank You.
