# introduction

I have learned about the regular of expression that usually often shortens the regex patterns to help the programmers to match, search and replace any text 

# body

In this topic we usually doing is to use the test method that takes regex so that we can apply the string and also return  true or false in our pattern if the pattern gets something or not, we use the method testRegex.test(teststr); and also done  the match literal string and the different possibilities and how to ignore the case while matching. 

# conclusion 

However the string sould be matched before regulating the expressiong and its possible to match any string that you want to match.
