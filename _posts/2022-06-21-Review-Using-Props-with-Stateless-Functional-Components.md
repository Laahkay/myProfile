# Introduction

I have done the Review Using Props with Stateless Functional Components for today.

# Body 
I was struggling with this task i all most spend about 3hours because i did not want to be helped just trying to do it alone so the task wanted m e to render a CampSite in the code and also it wanted me to render a component of Camper  that should include the default props which willl be assign to the string CamperBot to the key name and also to bring the requred name props to be of type string so what i did here is that i have  Define the Camper component and assign it default props of { name: 'CamperBot' } and inside the Camper component i have render it as it have the key name and as well as the CamperBot inside the string so i have passsed the name in as a prop so that it can be defined as propType on the Camper that i have rendered in my code so it was able to varify the key name as a prop and it have allowed me to pass the task.

# Boby 
And after that i went to another task which  is how to create a stateful component so in this task is where by we learn about this.state method so here i was ask to do is that the statwfulComponent should be able to initialize with the property of FirstName and that it should be set to a string and i was able to figure it out and i went deep on thinking and iwas able to get it right at the end off the day.

# In Conclusion 
I have some dificulties on solving this task that i have done today but it was not a big deal to stark on something but at the end of the day you get it correct i will be pushing more lately. Thank you.
