# Introduction

I was doing a project of creating javascript calculator using HTML,CSS and JAVASCRIPT.

# Body

I was doing the functionality of my calculator that where i have started by getting the id's of the display-result and also the display and after that i have to create a function that clear's all the values that have been clicked that it delete all the values so that you can re-calculate so i have moved to another funtion which is the del() function that it will be used to delete values one by one then i will be using the slice method to make the function work so hence i did that it was ready to be used so i have to create a function that can display my numbers that i have clicked or trying to calculate so i have created a function that gets the display and display-result to the innerHTMLText so that it can show the clicked values and lastly i have created the calculate function that will calculate all the values and bring the answer to the display-resilt screen i may say it like that so an di also used the method eval() so that it can add numbers inside the strings.

# Conclusion

I have done the functions thwe way i wanted them to be then the calculator is working so i will be trying to re-style it well then i will be done with the calculator.
