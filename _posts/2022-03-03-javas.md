# Introduction

I was going functional programming on knowing how to use high orders and also using the sort method and using the  the split methods and join method and how to apply functinal preogramming to convert string to URL slug and every method thats all for today.

# Body

I may start by explain what i have learned on how to sort Array alphabetically using the sort method sorting the elements of an array according to the callback fuctions here is an exxample of sorting the an element of an array  alphabetically 
function reverseAlpha(arr) {
  return arr.sort(function(a, b) {
    return a === b ? 0 : a < b ? 1 : -1;
  });
}

reverseAlpha(['l', 'h', 'z', 'b', 's']);
thats how we sort them

And also we learned how to return a sorted Array  without changing the original array and we dont include the slice or concat methods because those methods only brings the new array so by usng the sort so we use the const fuction so thatthe code should not change to be constant by the way i have learned how to use the split on spliting a string into an array with this methos hence it takes an argument for the delimenter which can be characterize  by using the break spo that we can break the string so here we will be looking for spaces on the words that you hvae created on your string but we dont forget that we shall not change the code that it is ben created by using cost here an example bellow

const str = "Hello Alicia";
const bySpace = str.split(" ");

const otherString = "How9are7you2today";
const byDigits = otherString.split(/\d/);

it should return Hello Alicia how are you doing today.?

# Conclusion

thats what i have learned for today and i find them interesting those methods because the defenatly make it easier for us not tp change our given code and returning something which is proper and understandable.
