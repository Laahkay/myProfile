# BODY
 Today i have learned about how to use component with composition it is where by we have to include the parent component anfn we have to render it at the end of the tast so i learned that we can render both child and parent component when we are composing is react so here is an example of it <ChilComponent /> and i was able to pass the tast and i have went to another tast 

 # BODY 
 The next tast i was able to do it and understand it better here is where we have been given some components to use so the thing is that i have to return a Fruits component and also the TypesOfFruit and i was able to do it and i did not have any problem on solving it and another thing is that The result should be a child component, nested within a parent component, which is nested within a parent component of its own 

 # CONCLUSION 

 In conclusion i have completed this tast without any struggles so it was an archivement to me that i have able to do them by my self and react it the most understandable languege and i am been able to cope with it.
