# INTRODUCTION

Learning  how to compose react component 

# BODY

Learning to compose in react is more complex compositions with React components and JSX where by we have to render and then i learn tht we can render JSX elements, stateless functional components, and ES6 class components within other components.

# BODY

so what i have done today is that the task should return different type of Fruits list and Vegetables ass well and as well we shal return the Citrus and NonCitrus it was not that challenging for me because i found it useful to me and i can understand it much better the good thing is that i was able to pass the task so then i went t a nother task where by i have to render a class component to the DOM the DOM method is was so understanble to me and it makes sense because when we use the DOM we will be able to return whatever component that we have written in the test so it was not that hard because all we have is to put this at the end
( ReactDOM.render(<ComponentToRender />, targetNode).)

# CONCLUSION 

I cloud say that it was a very funfull day to me that i was able to pass this task today so it was a pleasure to me but i would have to note erything down so that i should not forget what i have done Thanks For Reading My blog post of today.
