# Introduction
I was doing the project on react using the Mock_data.json which have car model and names of people and campany and others

# Body  
I was using the Mock_data.json when your searching a particular car it should be displayed from the list of car that i have on my Mock_data which are about 1000 cars on it so i have used the methods that i have learned on JavaScript which are sort , filter and Map methods that how i would be able to do it so get the data by searching on my input that i have set and whatever i submit the name of the car that i want to see how many are there so i was able to get the car that i have searched and also the number of the car that have been shown i also get the names of the car owner and also the company and the email of the car owners.

# Conclusion 

I was able to do what i wnted to do and it was a sucess to me that i was able to return only the cars that i have searched out of 1000 cars that i have in the Mock_data.json. Thank you reading my blog post.
