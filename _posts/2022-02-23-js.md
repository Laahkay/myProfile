# introduction

I just started the course of debugging under JS to console the value i of a variable.

# Body

I learned how to check the consoled value of variable and also understand the difference between the freecodeCamp and Browser and also that they use the typeof to check the type of variable and to missoelled variable and function names and learned about how to unclose parantheses , brackets , brace and quotes and how to catch mixed usage of single and double quotes and learned on missing open and closing parenthesis after a function call and when arguement is passed in a wrong order when calling a function and also when one errors reinitialize variables inside a loop and prevent infite loops in the valid terminal condition.

# conlusion 

this debugging course it was so dificult to me i find it problematic to me but then i will have to re start over to get betterr understanding.
