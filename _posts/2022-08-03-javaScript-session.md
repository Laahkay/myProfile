# Introduction 
 
Amo going to speak about the js session i have with Tumi and Noxi 

# Body 
I write this because of the js session we had yesterday. we have learned about the js methods which are as follows split,splice,join,reverse,map,concat,fliter and reduce. Those methods i have mantioned there the session was all about them hence where were learning and asked to do them by our selve after each and every methods we have been tought by tumi so it become a seccess according to my understanding and it have been an honor to relearn those methods because i once had a problem on appplying the methods on the js code when they have given a test or something so i used to take to much time thinking about them and how to use them on JavaScript codes but now am starting to get the hang of of this methods i have learned so far.

# Conclusion
My conclusion is that i will have to study each and every method by my self when i have my extra time to test my self how far i can understand this methods which i have learned.Thank You for reading my blog post.
