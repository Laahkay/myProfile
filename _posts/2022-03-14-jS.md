# INTRODUCTION ,Create a Bootstrap Button
I have learned about bootstrap 
Bootstrap is a front end framework used to design responsive web pages and applications how Use Responsive Design with Bootstrap Fluid Containers ,Make Images Mobile Responsive ,Center Text with Bootstrap and aslo Create a Block Element Bootstrap Button so i will be explaining about them and give examples below.

# BODY

Let me star by explaining the use of responsive design with Bootstrap fluid container it is where the HTML5 and CSS section of freeCodeCamp we built a Cat Photo App. Now let's go back to it. This time, we'll style it using the popular Bootstrap responsive CSS framework,   <div class="container-fluid"></div> you should use that to complete the test and All HTML elements after the closing style tag should be nested in .container-fluid that how you will comple your test ,We shall be making an image mobile responsive by using thins link provided >>> https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/running-cats.jpg like this   <a href="#"><img class="smaller-image thick-green-border" src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/running-cats.jpg" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back."></a> because on bootstrap we all need to do is add the img responsive class to your image so that the picture should appear on ypur browser right after completing the test and your done and we come to the next test which is Center Text with Bootstrap and how to center in bootsrtrap we this method here <h2 class="red-text text-center">your text</h2>
 Thats how to cneter in Bootstrap note that but its nice to center thing like that and its simpler than others because the way i see it you can save time as well doing a code in one place after when your done with that we come to Create a Bootstrap Button on this one we have a Bootstrap which has its wn styles for button elements, which look much better than the plain HTML ones and thats true so when creating a Bootstrap button you willl need a <button class="btn-default"> and close it at the end with </button> thats where we can pass our test after that we go to the next test which was Create a Block Element Bootstrap Button is hwere by we give our button a squre block by using this method here bellow

 <button class="btn btn-default btn-block">Submit</button>
thats how we can get our button to be set in the block of buttons that was all for today thats what i did and learned.

# CONCLUSION

In my conclusion is thats i did find Bootstrap deficult as i think it was nicely well provided so i was able to complete those test alone without any getting problems ahead so that was all for today

Thanks For Reading This Have a nice day.
