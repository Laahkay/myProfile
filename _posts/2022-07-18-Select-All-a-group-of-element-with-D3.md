# Introduction

What i have done today it was how to Select a Group of Elements with D3 and Work with Data in D3. 


# BODY
What i have learned about this D3 so far is that we can us e SelectAll method to select a group of element hence it will returns an array of HTML nodes for all the items that will be matching with the String input we have slected like eg if we select the li which the list item  it will take all the li element and display them in the console log if we may check very carefully.

# BODY
And i have went to another test that Work with Data in D3 ao here its where i was introduced to other D3 methods such as data(),enter() so this methods helps us to get the data that its been stored out side the code which is been created else where so that how we access the data by introdusing those methods so that we can see that our code its working using the data that we have got in the code.

# Conclusion 
My conclusion is that D3 it kind'a makes things simple to change our code else where if we want to chanege it we do that by selecting the dataset that we need to change any code we could overite it but i will understand it as time goes on. Thank You For Reading my Blog post.
