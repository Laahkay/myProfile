In this challenge i was introduced to use connect and provider soohere its when i have learned that the provider is a parent component hence the is the child component is also the so here i have done the provider to connect hence i was using the provier as a wrapper component from the react redux so that it can wrap my React App.

# Body 

I have learned that we can use the provider and store together and wrap react App as a child component soo by doing that it is where the DisplayMessage will be displayed on our web brower and i have learned that the React Redux is a global variable.
