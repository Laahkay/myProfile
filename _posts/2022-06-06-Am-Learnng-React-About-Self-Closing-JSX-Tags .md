# INTRODUCTION

Am Learnng react about self-closing JSX Tags.

# BOBY-1

Learning how to use self-closing tags it was something that i was able to do me alone wihtout any help so is where by they introduced the self closing tag which is <br/> but there is something that i have noticed which is that we can use self-closing tags on <h><h2> because those they actually need to be closed becousae they work is to nest something such a text so that it can appear on our code so fo rnow all i know is that we can use the self-closing tags on the breaking line and horizontal line for now the good news is that i was able to get it right at the end.

# BODY-2

And again i was doing another test which was How to Create a Stateless function Component where we have asked to create a function called MyComponent and create a div which is not the self closing tag hence i wont work if we use the self-closing tag div it will give us an error when we want to pass the test i was able to get test done on time so it was not that difficult to handle.

# CONCLUSION

It was a hell of a good day today that i did not strugle that much and that i was able to do the test alone and in that case i will surelly continue my curriculum by tomorrow Thanks for reading this.
