# Introduction

I have done how to Set State with this.setState in React.

# Body 

When we are setting a state in react we actually use the methods that we have been given in freecodecamp for example 
this.setState({
  username: 'Lewis'
});
tt
that is how we set a state using react languege and also it have an example of the name in it so in React expects you to never modify state directly, instead always use this.setState() when state changes occur.and also react can improve its performence usng multiple of state in the our code so the setState can be a asynchronous basically react its a js library based on the Ui Component and which is easy to use when we are creating some states that we have created in our code editor in that task is that we have to set our name property to be equal to string using React Rocks so we ahve to create a button and see the result when we are rendering our state update so i was able too complete it and the results turn to be a success at the end.

# In Conclusion

It where by i started to understand how state work and how to declare a name using react js and also creating a button and making it work using Onclick handler to get the name and submit it so that will be all for today. Thank you for reading my blog post and have a nice day
