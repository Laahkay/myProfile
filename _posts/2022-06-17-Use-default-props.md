# Introduction

What i have did today is how to use default props and override dafault props 

# Body

In this challegenge i was ask to to render a shoppingcart so that the props can  be defined and using default props it allow us to define the location of the props and i have done a default props to render the shoppingCart items and i was able to do the challegenge and i went to another one which is How to override dafault props 

# Body 
How to Overide Dafault Props.this challenge was more similer to the last one i have done so was able to understand it very fast so it had me to think over it and wanted me to to add a prop to a component looks similar to how you add HTML attributes.for example i have to use this props here { quantity: 10 } to pass from the ShoppingCart compnent which is what i have done in that case so it was not that hard to figure it out by my own so i had enjoyed the challenge or may say test that will be all for teh day.

# Conclusion 

Thats what i have done for the day so it was a bit  of a challegenge though so on my next test i will be wait for it and actuallly do some more test cos now am enjoying react and another thing is that i have to read carefully and try to understand what to do and figure out the situation and do the tast accordingly.Thank For Reading this
