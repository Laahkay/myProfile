# introduction

Am on intermediate algorithm scripting i just started it this mix the OOP and Fuction Programming.

# Body

It is where by we start by using the Sum sll number in range by passing an array of two number and return the numbers plus the sum of all the numbers between them for example we use this sumAll([4,1]) that will retun 10 and this is because 1 and 4 the are all inclusive to 10 and i have gone to the other test which is the diff two array where we compare two array and return a new array with any item only if we find the two given array but they will return the diffence of the two array in the symmetrically  and for today that i have learned about its the wherefore art thou and this test it makes the fuction that looks through an array of objects in the first argument and return an array with all objects that have a matching names and values pairs i had a challenge on solving it because the where no hints but i got all the help from my seniors they helped me to understand what is happening and the methods that i shall be following.

# Conclusion

i had a major problems in this test but i will proberbly try to finish them as quick as possible so i will go back to the basic structure of javaScript to understand the methods clearly.
