# Introduction

Good day to you today will be writting about how to Extract State Logic to Redux and how i have managed to pass the task and  how did i understand it.

# Body 

First i had to define some action and make them a cosntant parameters hence i will be creating an addMessage which will be adding message so that i could return an action hence i was introduced to the reducer method so i was ask to create a reducer called messageReducer that will be handling the state from the messages so the hence the state should be equal to an empty array so the reducer method will be adding those messagies in an array held in the state that we have created so at the end we shall create a redux store and be able to pass the the reducer the with the messagies that we will be storing.

# Conclusion 

My conclusion is that i have learned that we can store messagies in the redux store by passing in an array of messages in the state that we have and store the where by we pass reducer it can be stored there. Thank you For reading my Blog post.
