# Introduction

I have done solving Functional Programming and this Functional Programming is another popular approach to software development. In Functional Programming, code is organized into smaller, basic functions that can be combined to build complex programs 

# Body

I was finishing up with the functinal programming under java and i was busy with how to apply functional programming to convert strings to url slugs using the reduce method where by we need to return the hypanated version for the URl and here is where we combine the practical problems which we have already passed in the previous courses here i have leaned about how to set the output into lowerCases and also to do not have some spaces on the string because here we are dealing with strings to and set the strings to lowerCases  and also learned how to remove elements from an array using slice instead of splice and also learned how to combine two array using the contat method here is an example when we want to return an array [1, 2, 3].concat([4, 5, 6]); it will return [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] using the concat method and hence we went feather i learned about how to add elements to the end of an array using concat instead of push method and it make it easier for us to add elements and also learned the reduce method to analyze data  and it it where by we use the Array.prototype.reduce() method that allows the general forms of array processing and it have a chance to show both filter and map if possible here is an example below

const users = [
  { name: 'Love', age: 34 },
  { name: 'Alicia', age: 19 },
  { name: 'Kgothatso', age: 21 }
];

const sumOfAges = users.reduce((sum, user) => sum + user.age, 0);
console.log(sumOfAges);

but then this is how an object can be returned containing the names os the users as properties with their ages as values.

# Conclusion 

we have learned that it is possble to use three methods which is Reduce,Filter and Map and also you can change the elements in order to add other elements.
