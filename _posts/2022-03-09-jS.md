# Introduction

I am at the Spinal Tap Case, and Pig Latin And Search and Replace, and also done the DNA Pairing and the Missing letters test for today.

# Body 

The Spinal Tab Case it where by we have to convert the string into the Spinal case  and this spinal cases are lowercase words which are also joined by the dashes in the middle of the words which are joined together, And the Pig Latin it is when you alterate an english words and it uses the const so that the words should not be changed or something it always stays constant without any changes made, And also i have done the Search and Replace test which performs a search and replace on the sentence using the arguments provided so that at the end you sould return a new sentence and NOte that in the first argument our sentence should start to perform the search and replace On and the second should perform a search and replace before or after any of that, And my next test was about DNA pairing which i have learned at school on life sciences itys where by we have to pair the DNA pairs which are adinine and thymine and guanine and cytosine the are represented by this letters A,T,G,C
 
 AND  this is how i have passed my test look at my exmple below

 function pairElement(str) {

  var pairs = {
    "A": "T",
    "T": "A",
    "C": "G",
    "G": "C"
  };
  var arr = str.split("");
  return arr.map(x => [x, pairs[x]]);
}
that my solution using the .Split() and .Map() metheod to return the string of my Dna pairs

lastly what i ahvve done is the Missing Letters where by i have to find the missing letters in the passed letter that they have given us and return it withi those letters which where missing intheir full range and at the end we shall return undifind which my undifine is and empty return and thats all for today

# Conclusion

In my conclusion i have some problems on the Pig Latin and Search and Replace as i got help on my seniors and the test that i have enjoyed doing was the DNA Pairing.
