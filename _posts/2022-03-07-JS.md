# Introduction

I what i have learned about today it was about the Interermediate Algorith Script along with OPP and Fuction Programming.

# Body

first i have learned about is sum all number in range and the diff two arrays and seek and destroy and other three following carriculum test.
the sum all number in range is where by we will have to pass the our arrays of two number and return the sum of two numbers plus the sum of all the numbers between them by using this method 
function sumAll(arr) {
  return 1;
}
you just add a method which can add number such as the join and splice metheds and  reduce method.
And the diff two array itwhere we have to compare the two arrays and retuen a new array with any item that is been found only in one of the two array provided so one the methods could work that i hae mantioned above and note that we have to return the array with its elements in any order, However in seek And destroy we just have to provide the initial array but where start with the Destroy fuction first and can follow other arguments but there we use the given object which is arguments in order to comp;e the test.

# conclusin 

This Interermediate Algorith Script it was giving me problems because you have to think about all the methods that you can  think of so that we can pass the test but then we i have reffered to the basic data structure of JavaScript to know the methods that i have to apply but it was worthit .
