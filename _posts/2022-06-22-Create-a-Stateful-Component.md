# Introduction
 i was doing how to create a stateful component in react.

 # Body 

 I have learned how to create a stateful  component by understanding how the state works so far and using this.state method to access our objects so  The state object can be as complex or as simple as you need it to be so i had to create a state property on the component class in its constructor and another thing is The state object can be as complex so i have to  create a class component by extending React.Component in order to create state so i have to render a component of firstname property from the state that i have created si had to assign my first name property into the state and constructor .

 # Conclusion
 thats what i have done for today so i didnt have any problems on solving it and i will keep on pushing.
