# INTRODUCTION

THIS IS WHAT I HAVE LEARN ABOUT TODAY
-------------------------------------
*Add Comment in JSX 
*Render HTML Class to DOM 
*Define an HTML Class in JSX
*Learn About Self-Closing JSX Tags
*Create a Stateless Functional Component

Those are my topics i have done for today on react.

# BODY 

In JSX i was learning how to comment it is where by we have To put comments inside JSX, you use the syntax {/* */} to wrap around the comment text.

I also learn Render HTML Class to DOM and  this method it is to render React elements to the DOM which looks like this: ReactDOM.render(componentToRender, targetNode), where the first argument is the React element or component that you want to render, and the second argument is the DOM node that you want to render the component to.

And i have went to another task which is how to Dine an HTML Class in JSX so in JSX is that you can no longer use the word class to define HTML classes. This is because class is a reserved word in JavaScript. Instead, JSX uses className.

And Again i have learn about the self-closing tags in JSX so which means that In JSX, the rules are a little different. Any JSX element can be written with a self-closing tag, and every element must be closed. The line-break tag, for example, must always be written as <br /> in order to be valid JSX that can be transpiled in JSX.

Learn how to create a Stateless function Component so here is where we learn how to create a statelss function components we simply write a JavaScript function that returns either JSX or null. One important thing to note is that React requires your function name to begin with a capital letter. Here's an example of a stateless functional component that assigns an HTML class in JSX: 

  const DemoComponent = function() {
  return (
    <div className='customClass' />
  );
}; 

# CONCLUSION

That's what i have learned about today in React and been honest i have enjoyed this lesson and i was more straight forwad to the point so i didn't even have some challengies so far.
