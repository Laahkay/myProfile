# Introduction

I was busy with freecodecamp doing javascript alne hence am re learning it.

# Body

I was busy with the concatenating strng with plus operator hence i will be joining sentences using the plus operator and i was able to do that and pass the test and i went to another one which was Concatenating Strings with the Plus Equals Operator hence i will be using the += operator to concatenate a string onto the end of an existing string variable the where you make to sentence of our string and make it one senctence hence they will be having a full stop at the end of each sentence that we have join them so i was able to pass the test so i have gone to another one which how to Constructing Strings with Variables here that is where have learned that we can just construct a string of sentences and then join them using their variable name using the the plus operator so that they can be a full sentence and that where i have ended up.

# Conclusion 

I will be busy with the this method of concatenating once more because it seems like its a good methods to learn about but though i will also be doing the javascript methods again.
