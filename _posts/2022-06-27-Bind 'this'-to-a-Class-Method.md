# Introduction

What i have learned how to Bind 'this' to a Class Method.

# Body

what i have learned is to use the Bind 'this' to a Class Method hence this method allows us to make the onClick button to work whenever we click it so fisrt thing that i have learned is that we can setState first and and knowing that on on our button we have to put an handleClick and also use the this method on our handleClick and at the at we have to bind it so that whenever we click  the button element in the render method. It should trigger the handleClick() method when the button receives a click event so this the way to show that our button is working in order to submit something it will be shown in our Console that it have submitted what we have have to submit is either its a form or something else that the browser can interprit that is the JavaScript code or not so thats what i have learned for today 

# In Conclusion 

In my Conclusion i can say that i have noticed that the this statement it only works with the setState and also we have to bind it to validate our button that it can be active/able to work when we click it. Thank you for Reading my blog post.
