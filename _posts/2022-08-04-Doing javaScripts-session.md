I will likey to explain about what i did yesterday which was JavaScript i was practice the methods of javaScript so now i know how to apply js methods in some of the JS code when am using filter and map and also the indexOf methods its kind'a pretty cool knowing how to apply js methods because last time i did not know how to use methods i use to take long directions in order to do some js test and in that case i was an able to finish in time but now i think i will be able to do them and finish in time the thing i need now is to practice more about the javaScript because i have forgetton most of the JS but i will do just fine if i can keep up on reminding my self that languege which is JavaScript
