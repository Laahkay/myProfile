# INTRODUCTION

Uhm what i can say for today i was doing the project In the React curriculam which was the JavaScript Functional Calculator.

# BODY 

 I was doing my project the whole day which is the calculator so it was m y first time soing a project like that and it where by i have to learn more about JavaScript Code because it was a bit hard to complete all all am glad about is that it was a bit tricky according to the freecodecamp guide so i was able to manege to understand while was reading the guide and also i had to google more information about the calculator so once i had done that i have seen the example of the project so i was able to make my own calculator using the code that i have been learning in Freecodecamp so it became a success hence i was coding along the way so i had it going pretty well but i wont say it was easy but i was able to finish it today.

 # IN CONCLUSION

  In my conclusion i may say that i had the most good practice while i was doing the project hence i was upgrading my skill in coding so it was a bit helpful to me so i have gained something today. Thank you for reading my Blog post have a wonderful day ahead.
