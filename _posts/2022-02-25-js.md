# introduction

I was doing the basic data struscture on JS on

# body

i was learning about how to  create complex miltiple-dimension  where by an array can very quickly become a very complex data structure as we have seen arrays that contain arrays in previous challenges and also learned how to add akey-value into the javerscript pairs on the object and on objects are just collections of key-value pairs on the other word they are pieces of data mapped to unique identifiers called properties so that we can modify an object nested within an object hence we can access properties names with the bracket notation and also learned about how to delete keyword and remove object properties

# conclusion

these properties can be deleted and be removed at the same time if an object it is not needed so you can recorrect your object properties.
