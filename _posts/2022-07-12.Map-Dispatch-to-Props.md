# Introduction

I was doing the Map Dispatch to Props today in freecodecamp.

# Body

What i have done is that i have to use the Map Dispatch to Props function to provide a specific action to the creator on my Reacy componentso they can Dispatch along the Redux Store so thsi challenge is also similar to what i have done yesterday  but here the is a Store.Dispatch and it should be conducted to the dispatches using the Map Dispatch to Props method so this method helpts on storing some data the maybe we i have submitted either is a form or app so this method helps the users to login with the details so that the Redux Store can save the the data and keep it safe but as i know its not only the redux store thata can save data of the user but also the json parse it can also store. So thats what i have learned today

# Conclusion

In My Conclusion is that we can store thing using the redux store hence we have logged into something with the detail we have logged in with so now i underrstand the use of the redux store do and helps us on. Thank you for reading the my blog post.
