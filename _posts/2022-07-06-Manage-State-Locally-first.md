# Introduction

I have done how to Manage State Locally First on creating the DisplayMessages in the component.

# Body

It was my first time creating a button in React Reddux and that i have learn to map messages as in the array so it was a pleasure to know how to map in React Redux where i was mapping messages in an array and also i have created a buttong that include the handleChage that have been updated in the input and also i had to use the submitMessage() method that sould be concatenated in the current message that have been stored in the input from the message array in the local state also i was able to clear the values of the input.

# Body

Hence i was using the map method i was ask to use the ul to map over the array o fthe message that i have created so that be rendered into the escreen as a list of li element so i was able to do that and thats where i was finally starting to understand more about the map method.

# Conclusion 

My conclusion is that i have learned something new using the map method in the ul and render it to appear on the screen as a list of li element which i did not know but it was glad to know it. Thank you for reading my blog post.
