# Body

I have started with understanding to make a reusable javascript functions hence i have to create a function of reusableFunction and also to include the console log of Hi World hence my code will be like this 
function reusableFunction() {
  console.log("Hi World");
}
reusableFunction()
so i was able to pass the task so easly 

I have went to another one where i have to pass values to function with arguments i have i did pass the argument wwhich is one and two and at the console.log i have set the arguments as one + two so that in my function when is called i could place 1,2 inside then it will out put 3 so this was the code i have done as it my solution
function functionWithArgs(one, two) {
  console.log(one + two);
}
functionWithArgs(1,2)//output 3
