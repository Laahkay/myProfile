# Introduction

I was doing the JavaScript kata project using the html and javascript doing the display names.

# Body
 I was doing the Display name involving the html and js code where by i have to set the input of name and surname hence i have  included the table where by i have to display those input in the table so i have use the getElementById() method so that i can get the input by ID's so that i can be able to submit the values that i have pass in the input and be able to work although i did not forget to put the button and i have git it an onclick funtion so that i can use it in the javascript code so i was able to do that project succssefully so i was able to get the results that i wanted where by i have to put the names on my input and click the submit button is have to display the names in the table area.
