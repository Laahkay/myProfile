# Introduction

I Was doing the map state to props and also the

# Body 

I have learned how to use map that is one of the most interesting thing to do so here i learned that about the mapStateToProps and mapDispatchToProps hence i wanted to complete the challenge so i have to declare what pieces of state you want to have access to and which action creators you need to be able to dispatch so this function they have to be set in the correct way so that i could pass the challenge 

# Body 

So i have to make the function that i have created to take in state as an argument the the code should return the object which i have mapped so that my state can specify the the properties of names and be able to be accesible to the props as well so i have done the things that they have asked me to do then i was able to complete the challenge.

# Conclusion 

My Conclusion is that i have learned more about the mapStateToProp and also the mapDispatchToProps i have seen that they work hand to hand in order to find the correct names.Thanks You For Reading My Blog Post.
