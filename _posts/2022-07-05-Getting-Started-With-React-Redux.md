# Introduction

I was doing React Redux its where i was learning how to do react and redux at the same time.

# Body

In this challenge they have introduce how to use Redux with React hence we know that React is a view library that you provide with data hence it renders the view in an efficient, predictable way and Where by Redux is a state management framework that we use to simplify our Applications state so they also introduced the redux store that hold the data and also the dispatch action that triggers our store to update and i did not forget that React is it manages its own state locally when we have a complex app so in this challenge we have to display out messages component by adding the constructor that can we initialize by the state that have two properties which is Inputs adn the string of message so i was able to understand the use of props and the constructor and super methods.

# Conclusion

So its where by i hvae noticed that React and Redux they can assist each other hence Redux it can act as a Store some data that we have. Thank you For Reading my Blog post.
