# Introduction

I was proceding with my project that i did no finish last week friday.

# Body

I was busy with the project that i was doing last friday so today i was able to do it hence i have asked for help in some places where i was stuck adn when it did not want to work giving me errors in my code so i was strugglng with it i thought it was pretty easy to do but i was challenging and i did go back to React and Redux a lil bit to remind my self some code that i did not understand very well.

# Plan

My plans for this project it was to keep it stand by and redo React and Redux once more then i will try to do it alone a then see what i have learned and i hope that it will work out very but i know it will 

# Conclusion 

In my conclusion is that i shall go ahead with my lesson of React and Redux and i will complete my project later on. Thank you for Reading my blog post.
