# Introduction

I have started the Data Visualization with D3 and i have done the Add Document Element wiht D3.

# BODY

I have started with D3 today so i was googling about the D3 seeing the examples of it so it let me on this first test of the D3 which is the Add Document Elements with D3 so what i have learned about it is that its not the same as the other test i was doing before because the way it is its diffent because we so the code using the select adn the append and the text so that how we take an arguement in D3 by using the select and using the brackets after and the paremeters are inside it hence it will work that way by selecting and appending and psutting the text on is so that the text should be displayed on the console log..

# Conclusion 

In my conclusion is that D3 its diffent from other langueges that i have done so that how it is so special about it but i think it make the code to go longer if you will be using the D3. Thank you.
