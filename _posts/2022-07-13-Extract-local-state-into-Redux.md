# Introduction

I was doing how to Extract Local State into Redux today 

# Body

Thats the topic of today was Extract Local State into Redux thats where i have learned about how to extract the stae management out of the PResentational component into redux and also i ahve learned how to handle the state locally within the Presentational component so i have managed to modify the submitMesage method so that can be dispatched from our props as a new submitMessage from our local state as an argument hence i learned how to remove the message property from a call to setState and also i had modify the render method so that i can use the map method over the messages that have been received from our props not into the state that i have created.

# Conclusion 

In my conclusion is that after modifying the all the code that we have been ask to do the reduc will always continue to fuction the same way it will never change its functioning except if we change the code somewhere somewhere. Thank you for reading my blog post/
