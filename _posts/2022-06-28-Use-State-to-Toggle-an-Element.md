# INTRODUCTION

What i have learned today is how to Use State to Toggle an Element in react.

# BODY

In this use state to toggle an element using state we have to so the setState and also we should use the this.props or this.state in order to toggle the element that we are targeting in our code so thats where they have introduce a away to toggle an element using the method that they require us to follow so that we can can not make some of the errors in our code so they have shown us the way to toggle our element so i was able to understand where we have to setState of visibility hence we will be targeting the togglevisibility() in the component of the state and we should not forget to bind the this keyword to the method constructor.

# IN CONCLUSION 

For what i have learned or discovered is that we wont be able to target our button without using the this method and bind and also the constructor method it important to check the code when we are starting it because some method are very important such as constructor and super and props and the main thing State.
