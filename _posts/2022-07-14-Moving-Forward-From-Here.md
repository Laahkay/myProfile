# Introduction
I was doing the last tet of how Moving Forward From Here on React Redux.

# Body

iI have learned how to create the whole React Redux code that i have been tought on my previous test that i have completed on freecodecamp so i have done the how to import React from react and i have created the reacdom and also i have provided the provider anf the connect method from redux and others such as Creating the Store and the combineReducer methods  hence i have done all the steps requres me to do so i have done it so it was a pleasure to finish the React redux test today so i dont have much to say but i will kindly appreacite the efforts i have done to complete this course.

# Conclusion 

My Conclusion is that i have to redo React Resux once again in order to know it very well not to forget what i have done am sure that i will no longer striggle that much when i have to repeat it again so Thank you for reading my Blog Post.
