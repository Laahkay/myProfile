# Introduction

I was doing the Todo Project today.

#
I am currently busy with the todo project so i have started it hence am having some problems where by teh submit button its showing some errors and does not want to submit so i will have to redo the button on my todo list project to see that whats the problem is after that i will have to seek some help on my one of my seniors to tell me what could be the problem in my code because i currently not see the problem to its a bit harder to do the React Todo app when is my first time but i will see what i can do so i willl surely try to finish it this week and get to freecodecamp once more and see what i can learn next.

# Conclusion

My Conclusion is that i wlll have to complete the project before the friday and push on freecodecamp Thank you for reading my blog post.
