# Introduction 
 
 I was doing the javascript test given by tumi where by the test had a virable of a name in javascript code and it included the html code

 # Body 

 So hence we have a virable of name in the js code we had to tarted the button using the get element by Id method to trigger our button hence we have to submit the name when we click the button and the results should be the name that is been written in our javascript virable hence it is not a global virable we where able to get the name after checking that the button is working or what so after that i was able to sumbmit the name and show the name that was writtern in my variable name so it was a success to me because i will need to know more about JvaScript.

 # Conclusion 

 In my conclusion is that i will have to learn more about js and after i shalll apply what i have learned earlir on js methods. Thank you for reading my blog post.
