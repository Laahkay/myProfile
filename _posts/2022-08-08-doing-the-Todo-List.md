# Introduction

I was doing the Todo Project today.

# Body

I have started doing the Todo List project hence i want to check my knowleged that i still can do some coding by my own without any body's help hence i will be teaching my self an onClick to wrok and submit the values that i want to add on my list so i have to use the method i have learned ealier which is the map  method that i have learned on the session so i dont have much to say because am still busy with the Todo list and am still going to finish it whenever i get the chance to do it again so am going to put the styling after when am done with the functionality first.

# Conclusion

My conclusion is that i will have to finish my Todo list first and i will have to do another Project until i have know how to create button with its functionality . Than you for reading my blog post.
