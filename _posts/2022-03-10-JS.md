# Intro

I what i have done today is freecodecamp under JavaScript am still on Intermediate Algorithm Scripting doing the Sort Union and convert HTML Entities and Sum All Odd Fibonacci Number and smallest Common Multple And Aslo Drop It yes thats what i have learned for today,

# BODY 

The Sort Union it is the funtion that takes two or more arrays and returns a new array of a unique vaues so that it can provide an original arrays that have been provided for me to comple this test i used a particular method which had worked for me to comple this test here is an example

function uniteUnique(arr) {
let mySet = new Set();
for(let  el of arguments){
  for(let num of el){
    mySet.add(num)
  }
}
  return Array.from(mySet);
}

thats my example and the method i have have used to pass this test
And on the Convert HTML Entities we only convert the characters such as  &, <, >, " ,in the string so that they can corresspond with HTML entities although i have  a problem in convertions i cant say that i did it by my own just i have asked some help on doing this one, Here is another test about the Sum All Odd Fibonacii Number here all we have to do is to return the numbers which are equal or less than each to num, And Sum All Primes arre the Prime numbers which are whole number that are greater than 1 with exactly two divisors eg 1 and itself and another example is >> 2 is a prime number because it is only by 1 and 2 which makes 1, 2 to be divisble to 4, And another test was to Multiply The Smallest Common number by finding the smallest number and multiply with the given parameters that can be evenly divided by both for better underrstanding about what am saying is that if given 1 and 3, find the smallest common multiple of both 1 and 3 that is also evenly divisible by all numbers between 1 and 3 am surely now the is a clue for what am trying to say right? let me procide my last test for the day was the Drop it it is when have to remove the element starting from the first element from the O index but although our fuction should return true when the iterated element is passed through it if not it wont return true it will recently return undifine.

thats all for today!!!

# CONCLUSION

I have some test whom i have sto spend lot of time on trying to figure out so it was my biggest challenge doing the Intermediate Algorithm Scripting in JS buti wil surerly get the hang of it as i will repeat it once again by my self.
