# INTRODUCTION

I have learned how to Write a React Component from Scratch and also i have done moral's projct

# BODY 

i have have learned the basics of JSX and React components so i was ask to write the code of react from scratch so i was able to do it and another thing is that typical React component is an ES6 class which extends React.Component i was asked to Define a class MyComponent that extends React.Component and that i should use the render method to rendert  myComponent  also inclusde my first h1 text which is 'My First React Component!' and at the end i should use the ReactDOM.render() method so that the code can display my code that i have written also i should include the id of challenge-node cos we are getting an element that is been create behind the scene for us so i was able to write the codew down without any  struggles.

And i was ask to write a test of moral and it tpoook me time to answer it  and the bad thing is that  was not able to get a better understanding on how to solve them but i was able to get some correct but others i could not done them but i shall think twice as much as i was thinking to boost up make my speed.

# BODY 

In my conclusion what i have learned today was extra challenging whicng means i should go back and learn JavaScript once more because it seems like am lacking behind on the content of JS so i shall come with a plan to face the challnge once more that will be my conclusion for today session. Thanks You for Reading My Blog Post.
