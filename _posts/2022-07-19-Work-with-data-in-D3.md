# Introduction
I was doing how to Work with Data in D3 today and also i practicing react.

# Body

I have done a lil bit of freecodecamp on how to Work with Data in D3 it is when i was using the data() method in order to get the data set placed in hte code above in hte freeecodecamp test so i have learned that we can accesss the dataset using the data method when we are dealing with the D3 coding so that thats what i have learned so far about the D3 hence we will be taking the data from the dataset by calling it down in our code so that it can be displayed on our console log and i was able to pass the test that i was asked to do And after i went to React.js to remind my self about it because of the test i will be writting tomorrow so i had to be ready for it because some of the code we not easy to remember so thats why i went back to check on react.js code and example on understanding them props and render methods also the how to use States once again.

# Conclusion 

I have learned amore today on the D3 curriculum and also the react.js so i will be waiting for the test but before i start i will have to review the react once more to be sure that i had everything that i had studied about in my head Thank you for Reading my blog post.
