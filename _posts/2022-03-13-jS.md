# INTRODUCTION
i have learned about the Taste the Bootstrap Button Color Rainbow ,Call out Optional Actions with btn-info ,Warn Your Users of a Dangerous Action with btn-danger ,Use the Bootstrap Grid to Put Elements Side By Side ,Ditch Custom CSS for Bootstrap i will explain about them below

# BODY

In the first test its where we use the btn-primary class in the main color that we have used because it is usefull on highlighting actions that we want our users to take and after on the other test it is where we have to Call out Optional Actiond with btn-info and create a new button with the text info on it so that we can pass the test it was a sucess to me and i havegone to another test which is a Warn Your Users of a Dangerous Action with btn-danger in Bootstrap we find several pre-defined colors for buttons when we have the btn-danger class which will use ti notify users about the button performence and the destructive actions such deleting a photo so we have to create a button with delete and give it a class of btn-danger so i have creatw that and i was able to complete my test and went to another one That we Use the Bootstrap grid to put Element side By Side is where we have to set 12 responsive grid system which will make it easy to put element into the row and specify each element's reletive width for example Bootstrap's col-md-* class. Here, md means medium, and * is a number specifying how many columns wide the element should be in order for  the column width of an element on a medium-sized screen, such as a laptop And also we have to Put the Like, Info and Delete buttons side-by-side by nesting all three of them within one <div class="row"> element, then each of them within a <div class="col-xs-4"> element after we have passed the Row class in side the Div and the buttons themselves can be nested within it, My last test that i have done is Ditch Custom CSS for Bootstrap so here We can clean up our code and make our Photo  look more conventional by using Bootstrap's built-in styles instead of the custom styles that i have created in the last test i did dealing with photos here is what i have used to pass the test 

example
<h2 class="text-primary text-center">CatPhotoApp</h2>
thats my answer for the solution to complete it so i did it then i ahve completed it without any problems.

# CONCLUSION

This test where more understandable the where straight forwad on telling me what to do and what is my target which was the h2 just needed to put the test-primary and my h1 should no longer use the font monospace and add the img-responsive class to my image on top, Thats all for the day.
