# introduction

I have learned about how to find more than the first match and also how to match single character with multiple possibilities and others as i will explain feather more 

# Body

What i have learned is that when we are using regex we can multiply the things that we want to repeat and retun them and we use the /search/gi where we include the GLOBAL FLAG, there is where we match letters of the alphabet to specify a certern group of characters to match  although inside the character set we can define a range of characters to match using a hyphen characteer which is - for For example, to match lowercase letters a through e you would use [a-e]. 

# Conclusion 

In conclusion we can match any letter we want to use as well as wwe can define the  range of characters whwn using the hyphen mark REgex it makes it easier for us to multiply letters.
