# INTRODUCTION

I have learned for today is Learn How Script Tags and Document Ready Work and Target HTML Elements with Selectors Using jQuery, Target Elements by Class Using jQuery and Target Elements by id Using jQuery.

# BODY 

-->On how script tags and document ready work first of all we need to First, add a script element at the top of your page so that the browser can run using any javaScript inside the script element so we have to use this code bellow

$ (document).ready(function() {} note that you put your script inside so thar our function can work because without that method our code will run before our html when is rendered which will also cause bugs,
Target HTML Elements with Selectors Using jQuery the in this test we have to use the doller sign operator($) because our code will have to start by it so we create buttons differently in JQuery here is an example 
$("button").addClass("animated bounce");
thats how we create our button in JQuery but then we have to make our button bounce so we have to add a JQuery addClass() and we give it a function of the class animated and bounce inside our button

And on the other test on how Target Elements by Class Using jQuery we target them by using  this method $("button") and .addClass("animated bounce"); but then you will require to target inside our div hence we will be using $("well") selector but here is the full method
doller sing here($) (".text-primary") remove .addClass("animated shake") ;
thats a tipical example on how to approch this task given about JQuery.

# CONCLUSION

I have found JQuery not that dificult to answer and it is easy to understand it unlike JS and its more simpier to work with so far i dont have any problems using it,
