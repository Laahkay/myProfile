# INTRODUCTION

I have learned about this topic as follows Delete Your jQuery Functions,
Target the Same Element with Multiple jQuery Selectors and
Remove Classes from an Element with jQuery for today so am going to explaining about them

# BODY

In the this tasks  first we have to delete all our three JQuery Functions from our document ready function and after we have to target the sum element with multiple JQuery Seectors we can target our element by type and also id another thing it is  possible to add multiple classes in a single .addClass() call but here we are dealing with class which we have to target on

And we also have to make the button to shake by adding the animated class inside our button and also by adding the btn-primary class to all our button with the class .btn wiht the id #target1,

and when we remove classes from an element with JQuery all we have to do is to add removeClass() function to remove the classes that we want to remove in our code  here is an example how to remove classes from element with jquery check bellow
 start by putting a doller sing($)("#target2").removeClass("btn-default");
note that we have to put the btn-default son that the class can deleted or be disabled 

# CONCLUSION

I have not found any dificulties in todays tasks so this means am enjoying JQuery at this point but then i have taken to much time on i just needed to understand it clearly so that i dont have to forget all what i have learned on todays lessons.
