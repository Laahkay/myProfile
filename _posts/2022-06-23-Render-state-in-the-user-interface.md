# Introduction

I have done how to render state in the user interface and alsp how to render statte in the user interface another way.

# Boby 

So today i have learned how to use state which is the most powerful features of component in react so this allows us to track our important data in our app and also we could render our UI in the response to change in the data so here they introduced me to the the React Uses called Virtual DOM  and another thing is that the state is completely encapsulated, or local to that component, unless you pass state data to a child component as props so in that task i was asked to return an h1 that renders the key of name inside it and should render it from MyComponent state and to be aware about the use of curly braces as well so i was able to return the key name with the value of Freecodecamp.

# Body 

After that i went to another task where i have to i should get the name stored in MyComponent which is FreecodeCamp so i have to render the key name in a diffent way using the curly braces eg {name} in my h1 so that it cam return the name that my component that is been stored In MyComponent so i was able to find a way to pass the task as i did that i was able to do it.

# In Conclusion

I had a little misunderstanding with the things that they wanted me to do in those task i was doing today so thats why i took too much time on getting the tast right from the begging but it went pretty well at the end so thank you for reading my blog post have a nice day.
