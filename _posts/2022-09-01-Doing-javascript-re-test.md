# Introduction

Doing the javascript assingment re-test
# Body 
I was doing the javascript test that i have been given the previous day so i was currently busy with it so i wanted to see that will i be able to get the values that i have to return in my console.log so it seems like i have done it and i was able to get the right values in my console hence i was checking if i use the different methods of javascripts which was the slice and splice and also the filter and the for loop methods hence i was able to complete my re-test alone becauswe this test tought me some things that i did not know so  now i finally understand how this methods works now.

# Conclusion 

My conclusion is that i should do more of this kind of test of javascript so i want to learn more about it and be able to archive the greater price out of my hard work. Thank you for reading my blog post.
