# introduction

I was doing the Object Oriented Programming on JS its an OOP or the object Orianted preogamming and mostly important thing is that the OOP , objects and classes organize code to describe things

# Body

I have learned How to create a basic JavaScript  objects and objects are things that people can interect with such as Cars which got wheels and Birds which they got wings so objects in JavaScript are used to model the reasl world objects by giving them properties and behaviors just like their real world counterparts for example >>let chicken = {
  name: "Alina",
  numLegs: 2
};<<
And also learned about how to use the Dot Nptation to Access the Properties of an objects by inclusing the >>>Console.log(chicken.name)<<< Hence we learn how to create a method on an object such as >>>sayName: function() {return "The name of this duck is " + duck.name + ".";}
};
duck.sayName();<<< however we can make code more reusable with the keywords of >duck.name< for example  <sayName: function() {return "The name of this duck is " + duck.name + ".";}
> but we shall be careful about the errors this method must be longer having more objects using the dot notation to access the value for the name property within the return statement that your tring to return And we also can define a Contructor Function to create new objects and They also define properties and thir behaviors that will belong to the new object. Think of them as a blueprint for the creation of new objects for example we
 <function dog() {
  this.name = "Bruno";
  this.color = "Blavk & White";
  this.numLegs = 4;
}>
Thats how we define a Constructor Functions.

# Conclusion

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a style of programming characterized by the identification of classes of objects closely linked with the methods (functions) with which they are associated. It also includes ideas of inheritance of attributes and methods.is a style of programming characterized by the identification of classes of objects closely linked with the methods (functions) with which they are associated.
