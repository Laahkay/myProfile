# Introduction

I was besically doing Use PropTypes to Define the Props You Expect And also Access Props Using this.props today.

# Body
It is where by i was asked to use the PropTypes to define the props so here in this tast i was asked to Define propTypes for the Items component to require quantity as a prop and verify that it is of type number and another thing i have learned it that the propType property can be also defned as defaultProps in the components so i have learned how to import PropType from React so the example i will provide below as i took it in freecodecamp examples so it have given me a clue for what i can do to get the task done so here is an example.

MyComponent.propTypes = { handleClick: PropTypes.func.isRequired }
Thats the example am surely you will undersatnd it and i was able to complete the task

# Body 

After i went to another task which was how to Access Props Using this.props so here iwas asked to return a div which had a child component of welcome and also teh props called name adn at the end it should display the name prop within a strong tags so i was able to do the taskk but though i have asked for some help onn this and they helped me and i was able to complete it 

# In Conclusion
