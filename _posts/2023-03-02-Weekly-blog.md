# Introduction

I will be updating you about my week updates where by i will be explaining about my challengies and my wins.

# Body

I would like to say this , during my week I had a project where by I will have to create a demo student register application project using REACT and MSQL database whereby students should register and also select their subjects and be able to save the details in the database and latesly be able to login with the same details that they have provided to the database. So I had some challenges on creating 3 tables and joining them. On this register form, once a students finish with their registration they should be able to get their data back with their details and subjects and their student numbers as well so I had to do some reseach on how to join 3 tables so that the registering process is once finished MYSQL database should be able to send their data back once they have finished. So on my challengies finally find some examples on how to join those table which are user table, subject table, and userDetails table so I used some of the methods i foud on my reseach so the methods are 1 foreign key refference and the inner join methods ,Which are sql methods which mean those are my wins and also I had some challengies on the Express Route for getting student details so i had to come up with a way that I can get the route running with a a proper syntex so that i can finish with my backend code and be able to start my frontend.

# Conclusion

I have foud some challenges on linking 3 tables and express routing syntex. So my wins is where by after my reseach i was able to find some clues and examples on those challengies i was facing so i had to use foreign keys and refference method and also joining them using inner join method so that will be all from me.
