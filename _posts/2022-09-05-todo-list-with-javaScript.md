# Introductiona

I have started with the todo List 

# Body 

I was doing the todo list using java script and html code i have started building the inputs of the list and on the javascript code i will be getting the id and make sure the values will be working so that i can be able to submit the information and also that i should include the button in my form of the todo list that will be a better way to get my values that i have creared in my html code.

# Conclusion

I will be busy with the todo list until it works and i will be also checking the tutorials for other methods. Thank you for reading my blog post.
