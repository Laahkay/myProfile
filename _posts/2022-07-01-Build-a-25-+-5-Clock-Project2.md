# Introduction

I am doing a project of front end which is to Build a 25 + 5 Clock.

# BODY 

I am currently doing the project and i have not done with it yet so currently noe am stuck am still thinking of a way of completing it because it need time and able to understand it and get the code correct so am taking things easy on it because am not planning on forgeting it so i will be done by it monday if am not mistakening so now am half way done with it i have created few id's that they told me to create so all i have to next they include JavaSceipt code so for now i will say am done for the day.

# Conclusion 

My conclusion is that i will have to go back on JavaScript to check some code that i dont currently use to understand better so i will be able to finish it in the up coming day when i will procede with the project. Thank you for reading my blog post.
