# INTRODUCTION

What i ahve learned today is about the following topics Target the Children of an Element Using jQuery,
Target a Specific Child of an Element Using jQuery,
Target Even Elements Using jQuery and
Use jQuery to Modify the Entire Page

# BODY

For today i have learned that we can Target the Children of an Element Using jQuery
When HTML elements are placed one level below another they are called children of that element and and we will have to call a jQuery has a function called children() that allows you to access the children of whichever element you've selected and Here's an example of how you would use the children() function to give the children of your left-well element the color blue this is the method to do it
($)("#left-well").children().css("color", "blue") note that remove the brackets on the doller sign so that the method can work, So after i have learn about how to target a specific child of an element using JQUery so hence in jQuery uses CSS Selectors to target elements. The target:nth-child(n) CSS selector allows you to select all the nth elements with the target class or element type example is provided bellow

($)(".target:nth-child(3)").addClass("animated bounce");
note remove the brackets on the dollaer sign and the code should start with the doller sign, After i have learned about how to target element You can also target elements based on their positions using :odd or :even selectors so the :odd selects the second element (position 1), fourth element (position 3), and so on example is provided bellow

($)(".target:odd").addClass("animated shake");
note remove the brackets on the dollaer sign and the code should start with the doller sign, And i went to the other task and learned how to Use jQuery to Modify the Entire Page this is where by i learned that jQuery can target the body element as well so this how we would make the entire body fade out: $("body").addClass("animated fadeOut"); and we are requested to Add the classes animated and hinge to your body element and pass the task and that was the last task about JQUery i have finish about it

# CONCLUSION
