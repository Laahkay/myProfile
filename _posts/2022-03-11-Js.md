# INTRODUCTION
i have learned about the steamroller and also the Binary Agents and the Everything Be True and arguments optional and how to make a person and lastly How to to Map the debris

# BODY

i have learned how to flatten a nestedarray and also accounting he varying levels of nesting and got to the Binary Angents on returning an english translated sentence of the passed binary string  but the task wants us to put some spaces in order to separete the sentences and i went on The Everything Be True task which check the predicated argument which is truthy on all elements of a collection  objects and although the truthy value are values that in JavaScript they translate to true values when evaluated on the Boolean context And i also went to the Arguments Opitional that  creats a function that sums two arguments together when one argument is provided then it returns a fuction that expects one argument and returns the sums and here we use the var sumTwoAnd = addTogether(2); method to return the provided sums that the function that have to return okay, I also done th next task which is Make a Person here is where by we use the this. method on making a person all we have to do is to fill in the objects constructor with this methods bellow 

getFirstName()
getLastName()
getFullName()
setFirstName(first)
setLastName(last)
setFullName(firstAndLast)

this method it helps on getting the task done because i find it dificult to solve but as i got some of the help that i needed i was able to get the method right and here is how i solve it using this method which is the easiest check the method bellow

i sarted by return = return firstAndLast};
this.setLastName = function(first){
    firstAndLast = first + "" + firstAndLast.split(")[1]};
}
this.setFirstName = function(last)
{firstAndLAst + firstAndLast.split("")[0]+ ""+ last};
this.setFullName = function (fullName){
    firstAndLast = fullName};
    };
thats my method that i have used to solve the task, lastly the last task i have done is Map the Debris it is where we have to return a new array that transforms the element's average altitude into their orbital periods  and so by solving that i have used my own method that have proberbly worked for me and i will leave the my method example bellow 
I started it like this.......

var Gm = 398600.4418;
var earthRadius = 6367.4418;return arr.map (function(elemnt)){
    element.orbitalaPeriod = Math.round(2 * Math.PI * Math.sprt(Math.pow(earthRadius + element.avgAlt, 3)/Gm))
    delete element.avgAlt
    return element
    });
}


# CONCLUSION

It was a very hard task that i have did but i marnaged to finish the Intermediate Algorithm Scripting and i am sure that i will make things better for myself next time so that i want to finish with JavaScript and go to Front end maybe it will be more challenging i dont know but am willig to put my best out of it,
Thats all for the day Thank you FreeCodeCamp.
